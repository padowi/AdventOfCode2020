Aaaand this is the beginning of the decline. I know that I'm supposed to be all smart and figure it out and learn new things, but these *"hard math"* problems... since I don't *"see"* math like some people appear to be able to do, I am just left stumped at these.

And that is fucking demotivating.

So, solved a, because that was easy, but b... yeah I have neither the energy, the time, and now nor the will, to make further attempts at it.

This one was pretty straight forward. Since every adapter should be used, and each adapter transforms joltiness upwards, whatever the input it, just sort it, and then pop the first element off at a time, calculate the diff between the jolt level left by previous iteration (or 0 if first element), store the diff, record the new jolt level, rince, repeat.

When there are no more elements, multiply the number of times the diff was 1 jolt with the number of times the diff was 3 jolts. Return that.

## 10b ##

Even after having read some solutions threads on reddit, I still don't *"see"* a solution.
And I have no interest in copying someone else's solution just to get that star.
